ANY REPEATED TAX MORE THAN ONE TYPE IS CALLED LOOP.
YOU PUT YOUR FVT SONG OON A REPEAT MORE.
SYNTAX-
WHILE<CONDITION>:
STATEMENT
WHY DO WE USE LOOP?
if any tax not repeat moretime and work easily this time using loop.
ITERATE-
It means that executing the block of the code over and over any time.
WHILE LOOP-
A while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given boolean condition.
In while loop  statement is executed then before or after insides the values.
FOR LOOP-
A for loop in python is a control flow statement  i.e used to repeatedly execute a group of statement
as long as the condition is satishfied .In for loop executed then after inside the value.
BREAK-
It is a loop control statement .It is used to control the sequence of the loop.It is a keyword in python.
CONTINUE STATEMENT:
With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next:
Example:
Continue to the next iteration if i is 3:
i = 0
while i < 6:
  i += 1
  if i == 3:
    continue
  print(i)
RANGE():
To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the range() function,

The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.
Example

Using the range() function:
for x in range(6):
  print(x)   
PASS STATEMENT:
for loops cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a for loop with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.
Example
for x in [0, 1, 2]:
  pass
